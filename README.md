# Diamond Kata

Run the main method in the class DiamondKata

Given a single character from the alphabet, this application will print a diamond of its output to the console, with that character being the midpoint of the diamond.



For example:

> Given A:

<pre>
A
</pre>

> Given B:
<pre>
 A
B B
 A
</pre>
  

> Given C:
<pre>
  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A
</pre>



For future expansions of the application I would discuss with the client what their needs are in order to create ideas for new features I could expand on such as different shapes, different characters or numbers, what will the output be used for, could I create a UI that takes the input in a more user friendly way, and displays the output in a more user friendly way, potentially saving the interactions for future use.
